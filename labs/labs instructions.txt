1.Deploy a three-tier web application:
Steps:
Set up a VPC, subnets, and routing tables
Launch an EC2 instance in each subnet and install the necessary packages
Create a RDS database instance and configure the necessary security groups
Deploy a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic to the EC2 instances
Create an S3 bucket for file storage and configure the necessary permissions
Deploy the web application on the EC2 instances and configure the necessary environment variables


2.Design a disaster recovery solution:
Steps:
Evaluate the criticality of your application and the required recovery time objective
Determine the necessary infrastructure and data replication method (e.g. cross-region, cross-account)
Set up Amazon Route 53 to direct traffic to the appropriate region in case of a disaster
Use Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS snapshots to store critical data and system images
Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and AWS CloudFormation to automatically deploy the necessary resources in case of a disaster


3.Create a serverless architecture:
Steps:
Evaluate the appropriate use cases for serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway
Design the necessary data storage solutions (e.g. Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB)
Implement the necessary triggers for AWS Lambda functions (e.g. S3 bucket uploads, API Gateway requests)
Deploy the serverless functions and configure the necessary environment variables and permissions
Test and refine the implementation as necessary.
Note: These are general steps for each project and may need to be adjusted based on specific requirements.




4.Create a hybrid cloud architecture:
Steps:
Assess the requirements for your workloads and determine which are suitable for the public cloud and which for the private cloud
Set up a VPN or Direct Connect connection between your on-premises network and the AWS cloud
Choose the appropriate services for data transfer, such as AWS Storage Gateway or AWS Direct Connect
Set up Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Amazon S3 buckets, and Amazon RDS databases for your public cloud workloads
Implement security measures such as VPCs, security groups, and network ACLs for both the public and private cloud components



5.Migrate a legacy application to AWS:
Steps:
Assess the current infrastructure and application architecture
Plan the migration strategy, such as lift and shift or re-architecting the application
Choose the appropriate AWS services, such as EC2, RDS, and S3, to host the migrated application
Set up the necessary network infrastructure, such as VPCs, subnets, and security groups
Transfer the data and deploy the application components in AWS
Test the migrated application and make any necessary adjustments



6.Implement a security-focused architecture:
Steps:
Assess the current security posture and identify potential threats
Plan and implement the necessary security controls, such as network segmentation and access control
Set up Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets and security groups
Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit, such as with Amazon S3 and Amazon EBS encryption
